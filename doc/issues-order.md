  - Impact: Improved data quality

##  Phase 3: Advanced Features (Medium Priority)

  8. Issue #16: Ephemeral Data Export

  - Why eighth: Allows users to save session data
  - Goal: Data preservation for ephemeral approach
  - Impact: User confidence in ephemeral model

  9. Issue #15: Settings and Preferences

  - Why ninth: App configuration (uses SharedPreferences, not database)
  - Goal: User customization
  - Impact: Better UX

  10. Issue #17: UI/UX Improvements

  - Why tenth: Polish and accessibility
  - Goal: Professional app experience
  - Impact: User satisfaction

##  Phase 4: Additional Charts (Medium Priority)

  11. Issue #10: Price Trends Chart

  - Why eleventh: Advanced analytics
  - Goal: Multi-country price comparison
  - Impact: Enhanced insights

  12. Issue #11: Cost Analysis Dashboard

  - Why twelfth: Comprehensive analytics
  - Goal: Multi-chart dashboard
  - Impact: Advanced user features

  13. Issue #14: Statistics Dashboard

  - Why thirteenth: Key metrics overview
  - Goal: Summary statistics
  - Impact: Quick insights

##  Phase 5: Optimization (Low Priority)

  14. Issue #18: Performance Optimization

  - Why fourteenth: Optimize ephemeral performance
  - Goal: Smooth experience with large datasets
  - Impact: Better performance

  15. Issue #12: Data Export Enhancement

  - Why fifteenth: Enhanced export features
  - Goal: Multiple formats, sharing
  - Impact: Data portability

##  Phase 6: Deployment (Low Priority)

  16. Issue #20: App Store Deployment

  - Why sixteenth: Production deployment
  - Goal: Publish ephemeral version
  - Impact: User accessibility

  Future Phases (After Ephemeral is Complete)

##  Phase 7: Persistence (Future)

  - Issue #40: Database Implementation
  - Issue #13: Cloud Sync

  Key Principles for This Order:

  1. Foundation First: Ephemeral implementation enables everything else
  2. Quality Assurance: Testing early prevents issues later
  3. Core Features: Charts and basic functionality before polish
  4. User Value: Features that provide immediate value to users
  5. Complexity Management: Simple features before complex ones
  6. Risk Mitigation: Proven ephemeral approach before persistence

  Dependencies to Watch:

  - Issues #8-11 depend on #6 and #7 (WebView and data layer)
  - Issue #16 should come after core functionality is stable
  - Performance optimization (#18) should come after features are complete

  This order ensures you build a fully functional, well-tested ephemeral application before adding complexity, while delivering user value incrementally.
