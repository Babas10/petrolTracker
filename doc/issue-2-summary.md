```

### 2. Validation System

#### Multi-Level Validation
```dart
1. Form Field Validation (UI Level)
   - Required field checks
   - Format validation (numeric, positive)
   - Real-time feedback

2. Business Logic Validation (Model Level)
   - Odometer progression validation
   - Price consistency checks
   - Reasonable value warnings

3. Cross-Field Validation (Form Level)
   - Total price vs. price per liter consistency
   - Date validation (not in future)
   - Vehicle context validation
```

#### Validation Rules Implemented
```dart
Vehicle Selection:
- Required field
- Must exist in database

Date:
- Cannot be in future
- Visual feedback for invalid dates

Current Odometer:
- Must be >= 0
- Must be >= previous entry for vehicle
- Numeric format required

Fuel Amount:
- Must be > 0
- Warning if > 200L (unusual amount)
- Numeric format with decimals

Total Price:
- Must be > 0
- Consistency check with price per liter
- Currency format validation

Price Per Liter:
- Must be > 0
- Warning if > $10 (unusual price)
- Auto-calculated from total/amount

Country:
- Required selection
- Must be from predefined list
```

### 3. Auto-Calculation Features

#### Dynamic Price Calculation
```dart
Auto-Calculate Mode (Default):
- Price per liter = Total price ÷ Fuel amount
- Updates in real-time as user types
- Maintains 3 decimal precision

Manual Mode:
- User can override price per liter
- Total price = Price per liter × Fuel amount
- Updates total when price per liter changes
- Toggle switch for mode selection
```

#### Consumption Calculation
```dart
Previous Entry Loading:
- Loads latest fuel entry for selected vehicle
- Extracts previous odometer reading
- If no previous entry, uses vehicle initial km

Consumption Formula:
- Distance = Current km - Previous km
- Consumption = (Fuel amount ÷ Distance) × 100
- Result in L/100km format
- Null if distance <= 0
```

### 4. State Management Integration

#### Provider Integration
```dart
Used Providers:
- vehiclesNotifierProvider: Vehicle list and selection
- fuelEntriesNotifierProvider: Save operations
- latestFuelEntryForVehicleProvider: Previous entry context
- vehicleProvider: Individual vehicle lookup

State Flow:
1. Load vehicles for dropdown
2. User selects vehicle → Load previous entry
3. Form validation with context
4. Save entry → Update fuel entries state
5. Navigate to entries list on success
```

#### Error Handling
```dart
Provider Error States:
- Vehicle loading errors (network/database)
- Save operation failures
- Validation errors from business logic

User Feedback:
- SnackBar messages for errors/success
- Loading indicators during operations
- Form validation error display
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations
```

### 5. User Experience Features

#### Loading States
```dart
Screen Loading:
- Vehicle dropdown loading state
- Previous entry loading indicator
- Save operation progress indication

Form Interaction:
- Real-time validation feedback
- Auto-calculation visual feedback
- Disabled states during operations
```

#### Navigation and Flow
```dart
Entry Points:
- Navigation bar "Add Entry" tab
- Floating action button from entries list
- Direct navigation from vehicles

Exit Points:
- Save success → Navigate to entries list
- Cancel → Navigate back
- Error handling with retry options
```
