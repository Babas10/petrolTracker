- **Large Dataset Handling**: Test with realistic data volumes (5 vehicles, 1000+ fuel entries)

### Performance Tests

#### Operation Benchmarks
- **Vehicle Operations**: 
  - Add: < 10ms per vehicle
  - Update: < 5ms per vehicle
  - Lookup: < 1ms per vehicle

  - Add: < 15ms per entry
  - Filter: < 50ms per filter operation
  - Sort: < 100ms for large datasets

#### Memory Usage
- **Typical Usage**: < 10MB for 5 vehicles with 200 fuel entries each
- **Large Dataset**: < 50MB for 1000+ vehicles with extensive fuel entries
- **Memory Efficiency**: Proper cleanup of deleted objects

### Widget Tests

#### UI Integration
- **Provider Consumption**: Test widgets that consume ephemeral storage providers
