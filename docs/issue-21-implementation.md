# Issue #21: Setup Flutter Project Structure

## Overview

This document details the implementation of Issue #21 - "Setup Flutter project structure" for the Petrol Tracker application.

## Issue Description

Initialize Flutter project with proper folder organization and architecture setup for a fuel consumption tracking app with D3.js chart integration.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Flutter Project Initialization**
   - Created Flutter project using `flutter create petrol_tracker`
   - Moved project files to repository root
   - Verified project structure integrity

2. **Folder Structure Organization**
   ```
   lib/
   ├── models/          # Data models for vehicles, fuel entries
   ├── services/        # Business logic and API services
   ├── providers/       # State management (Riverpod)
   ├── screens/         # UI screens/pages
   ├── widgets/         # Reusable UI components
   ├── utils/           # Helper functions and constants
   └── main.dart        # Application entry point
   
   assets/
   └── charts/          # D3.js chart files (HTML, CSS, JS)
   ```

3. **pubspec.yaml Configuration**
   - Updated app name and description
   - Set Flutter version requirement (>=3.16.0)
   - Added commented dependencies for future issues
   - Configured assets folder for D3.js charts
   - Prepared development dependencies

4. **Basic App Structure**
   - Implemented Material Design 3 theming
   - Created light and dark theme support
   - Built placeholder home screen with welcome message
   - Added app branding with fuel station icon

5. **Testing Setup**
   - Updated widget tests for new app structure
   - Verified app loads correctly
   - Ensured all tests pass

## Technical Details

### Material Design 3 Implementation

```dart
MaterialApp(
  theme: ThemeData(
    useMaterial3: true,
    colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
      seedColor: Colors.green,
      brightness: Brightness.light,
    ),
  ),
  darkTheme: ThemeData(
    useMaterial3: true,
    colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
      seedColor: Colors.green,
      brightness: Brightness.dark,
    ),
  ),
  themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
)
```

### Dependency Preparation

Dependencies are commented out in `pubspec.yaml` and will be uncommented in future issues:

- **State Management**: `flutter_riverpod`
- **Database**: `drift`, `sqlite3_flutter_libs`
- **Navigation**: `go_router`
- **Charts**: `webview_flutter` for D3.js integration
- **Development**: `build_runner`, code generation tools

### Project Structure Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between models, services, UI, and state management
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without restructuring
3. **Maintainability**: Logical organization makes code easy to find and modify
4. **Testing**: Structure supports unit and widget testing
5. **D3.js Ready**: Assets folder prepared for chart files

## Verification

### Code Quality
- ✅ `flutter analyze` passes with no issues
- ✅ `flutter test` passes all tests
- ✅ Material Design 3 properly implemented
- ✅ App launches successfully

### Structure Validation
- ✅ All required folders created with `.gitkeep` files
- ✅ Assets configuration ready for D3.js charts
- ✅ Dependencies prepared for future development
- ✅ Proper Git integration

## Next Steps

This foundation enables the following subsequent issues:

1. **Issue #22**: Configure SQLite database with Drift
2. **Issue #23**: Implement data models and repositories  
3. **Issue #24**: Setup Riverpod state management
4. **Issue #25**: Create app navigation structure

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `lib/models/.gitkeep`
- `lib/services/.gitkeep`
- `lib/providers/.gitkeep`
- `lib/screens/.gitkeep`
- `lib/widgets/.gitkeep`
- `lib/utils/.gitkeep`
- `assets/charts/.gitkeep`
- `docs/issue-21-implementation.md`

### Modified Files
- `lib/main.dart` - Complete rewrite with Material Design 3 and proper app structure
- `pubspec.yaml` - Updated dependencies, description, and asset configuration
- `test/widget_test.dart` - Updated tests for new app structure

## Conclusion

Issue #21 has been successfully implemented, providing a solid foundation for the Petrol Tracker application. The project structure is organized, scalable, and ready for the implementation of core features including database integration, state management, navigation, and D3.js chart visualization.
